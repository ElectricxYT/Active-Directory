# Active Directory (WIP)

## Objective

To install and navigate Active Directory to gain hands-on experience with its core functions.

# Why Active Directory?

**Active Directory (AD)** is a directory service from Microsoft that is used to manage users, groups, computers, policies, permissions, and resources within a Windows-based network. It functions as the brain, dictating who can access what, when, and how. It is installed on a **Domain Controller,** which is what stores and manages the information above for the entire network (or domain). As an IT professional, it's important to understand how to navigate and use Active Directory because it's used daily to **reset passwords, create, disable, or delete user accounts, join new computers to the domain, push group policy updates (e.g., auto-lock screens after 5 min), grant or restrict access to shared folders and systems, audit login attempts and track suspicious activity, organize users by department, location, or security level, apply software installs or updates remotely, delegate control to junior IT or helpdesk staff safely, and backup and restore AD objects.**

With this project, my goal to gain hands-on experience with all 10 of the above to assist me with a future IT job/internship.

## Steps

## Installing Windows Server 2022

|-| Active Directory is hosted through an application called Server Manager, which I must use on a Windows Server to properly set it up. 

1. I first navigated to Microsoft's website after searching "Windows Server 2022 download." I filled out the short questionaire and then downloaded the 64-bit .iso file.

(Downloading the .iso file)

2. I then installed the VM to VMware the same way as the Windows 10 VM, but I also ensured to go into the VM's settings and select the .iso file in **CD/DVD (SATA)**

   (Configuring the VM)

3. While following the setup, I made the username Administrator and set a password. After completing a few more prompts and waiting for the system to finish its download, my server was ready to go.

## Installing Server Manager

|-| I originally thought that Active Directory was setup on a regular PC, but that was wrong. As such, the screenshots below show me downloading Server Manager on my Windows 10 VM. Please keep in mind that I followed these same steps but with my Windows Server 2022. 

1. To install Server Manager, I first opened **Settings** and then **Optional Features**
2. Then, I clicked **Add a Feature** and installed:
   - RSAT: Server Manager
   - RSAT: Active Director Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Services Tools
   - RSAT: Active Directory Certificate Services Tools
   - RSAT: Group Policy Management Tools

## Setting a Static IP Address

|-| Static IP addresses are crucial for AD domain controllers because it ensures consistent and reliable network communication, simplifies administration, and prevents potential disruptions when accessing domain resources. Because this is considered best practice in the professional IT world, I decided to practice setting a static IP address with my home lab. 

1. First, to make sure that my VM would run on a static IP address, I went into VMware and then selected **VM,** **Settings,** and then **Network Adapter.** I then set my network connection to **Bridged: Connect directly to the physical network.**
2. Because the bridged connection was not working, I had to troubleshoot it by going into **Edit** and then **Virtual Network Editor** to configure the **VMnet0** connection. After setting it to the proper Ethernet adapter (since my VM is connected to the internet via my host PC's ethernet cable), my bridged connection issues were resolved.
3. After resolving the network issues, I opened **Powershell** on my host machine and used the *ipconfig /all* command, taking note of the IPv4 address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, and DNS Server(s) under the **Ethernet adapter Ethernet:** section.
4. Next, I opened my Windows Server and went to **Server Manager,** then **Local Server.** I then clicked on **IPv4 address assigned by DHCP** and selected **Properties** after right-clicking my Ethernet adapter. I then selected **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and then right-clicked to select **Properties.** Then I clicked **Use the following IP address:** and **Use the following DNS server addresses:** and set these five fields:

- IP address
- Subnet Mask
- Default Gateway
- Preferred DNS Server
- Alternate DNS Server

I then clicked **Apply** and **OK.**

5. Finally, I tested the Windows Server by opening Powershell and running the *ipconfig* command to ensure that what I set in the previous step matched the output of the command. I then pinged my router, 8.8.8.8, and google.com to ensure the connection existed.

## Verifying that DNS is working

1. To verify that DNS is working, all I had to do was examine the results of me **pinging google.com** from inside of the VM. Because I received replies from google.com with an IPv6 address, I can conclude that DNS works.

## Setting Up Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

|-| Active Directory Domain Services is the core component of Active Directory. It:

- Authenticates and authorizes users and computers
- Stores information about users, groups, computers, printers, and more
- Controls who can log in, access files, or join the network
- Enables use of Group Policy to enforce rules on devices

|-| In order to properly experiment and practice with Active Directory, installing and setting AD DS is a must.

1. I first selected the **AD DS** tab on the left of **Server Manager.** I then clicked **Promote this server to a domain,** thus opening the configuration wizard.
2. Next, at the **Deployment Configuration** tab, I selected **Add a new forest** and made the root domain name **Electricx.local**
![ActiveDirectory9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dfa2db5-7438-46e4-ac5f-c5fbc8d1c4fe)
   (The AD DS Configuration Wizard)

3. Then, at the **Domain Controller Options** tab, I set the **Forest functional level** and the **Domain functional level** to Windows Server 2016 and checked the **Domain Name System (DNS) Server** box. I then typed in the **Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password.**

   (The Domain Controller Options tab)

4. I then proceeded to the **Prerequisites Check** tab and waited for the prerequisite checks to pass successfully and then clicked **Install.**

## Create, Disable, and Delete User Accounts

|-| IT Professionals deal with user accounts on a daily basis. Therefore, knowing how to create, disable, and delete user accounts in Active Directory is crucial. 

### Creating a User Account
1. To create a user account, I first navigated to **Tools** and then **Active Directory Users and Computers.**
2. Then, under the **Users** Organizational Unit (OU), I right-clicked and then selected **New** > **User.**
3. I filled in the first and last name of the new user as well as their logon name.
![ActiveDirectory14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f6d04a5-c880-4bed-8af2-a93934849d3b)
   (Creating a new user)

4. Next, I filled in the user's password and checked the **Password never expires** box. If I were creating a User for a real person at a company, I would instead choose the **User must change password at next logon** so that person can set their own password. I can always change this by double-clicking on the user and going to **Account.**
![ActiveDirectory15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4208c1-b126-4d98-bf81-11c376de9b5d)
   (Successfully created user)

### Disabling a User Account
1. To disable a user account, I simply right-clicked the user and selected **Disable Account.** The icon of the user now has a down arrow next to it, indicating that it is disabled. This prevents the user from logging-in until the account is re=enabled.

   (Disabled account pop-up)

### Deleting a User Account
1. To delete a user account, I simply right-clicked the user, selected **Delete,** and then confirmed the deletion. Deletions are permanent unless the **AD Recycle Bin** has been enabled.

## Create Security Groups and Add Users 

|-| The purpose of security groups is to assign permissions to multiple users at once. This is a very useful skill for IT professionals because it saves time and makes user management more efficient. 

1. In **Server Manager**, I first went to **Active Directory Users and Computers** and chose an OU to create my group in. For this task, I made an OU and called it **Service Accounts.**
2. Then, I right-clicked and selected **New** and then **Group** in the OU pane. I gave the group the name **Service Users,** set the Group scope to **Global,** and set the Group type to **Security.** I then clicked **Okay.**

   (Newly created Service Users Group)

3. To add an user to the group, I first created a new user with the name **Kaden Williams.**
4. Then, I clicked on the Service Users group and navigated to the **Members** tab. I then clicked **Add** and typed in the full name of the user I wanted to add to the group (or, in this case, Kaden Williams). I then clicked **Check Names** and the user's name became underlined.
5. Finally, I clicked **OK** and then **Apply**

## Organizing with Organizational Units (OUs)

|-| Organizational Units, or OUs, are like folders. They used to group users, computers, and groups. They also allow you to apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and delegate admin rights. I practiced organizing with Organizational Units in the last step when I created an OU called **Service Accounts.** To make an OU, follow these steps:

1. Right click your domain name and select **New** and then **Organizational Unit.**
2. Type in a name for the OU.
3. Select **Protect from accidental deletion** if your OU is a critical structure (like HR, IT, etc), will have a GPO attached, is being delegated to someone else, or is part of your home lab (like mine). OUs with this setting enabled will have a special icon inside of the folder icon. If none of this applies and you could care less if the OU is deleted, then skip this step.
4. Select **OK**

|-| And just like that, you have a freshly-created Organizational Unit (OU)! It's important to note that OUs with **Protect from accidental deletion** enabled will be unable to be deleted unless that setting is disabled. To disbale it, follow these steps: 

1. In ADUC, select **View** and then **Advanced Features**
2. Then, right click the OU you want to delete and select **Properties**
3. Navigate to the **Object tab** and uncheck **Protect object from accidental deletion.** Then click **Apply** and **OK.**
4. Finally, right click the OU once more and select **Delete**
